# Image Gallery SPA with Infinite Scroll, Search, and Like/Dislike Functionality

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React, Vite, and TypeScript. It features an image gallery with infinite scroll, search functionality, and the ability to like or dislike images. The application is fully responsive and optimized for performance.

## Features
- **Infinite Scroll**: Automatically loads more images as you scroll.
- **Search**: Filter images by keywords.
- **Like/Dislike**: Toggle like or dislike for each image.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile and desktop views.
